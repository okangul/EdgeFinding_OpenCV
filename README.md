(1) Purpose of the project
Fall 2015
Authors Name: Okan Gul
Assignment 2
 The purpose of the project is to make clear the subject which is last learned in class. Finding edges on the images is one of the most used situation of image process with this project we get used to find edges on photos also see and try the different kind of ways to find them on the pictures. Also basically we learned the steps to reach our finding edge goal. With the Unsharp mask we make our image clear. Also with Gaussian blur we get rid of noise to make process on them. We learned sobel and log for edge finding.
I. Questions (46%):
(1) (10%) Given following four masks, order them in that generating smooth images from light
smoothness to heavy smoothness, Explain why.
M1: 111
111 111
M2: 121
242 121
M3: 010
141 010
M4: 000
010 000
 
Answer (1):
M1>M2>M3>M4
First one which is M1 is Mean(Box) filter which is a basic filter gets the 1/9 of all pixels. Second and third ones are Gaussian filter but differences between them is M3 is much
more concentrates the middle pixel because of that M2 makes the image much blurry. Last one gives us the same of the image because it isn’t make any process on it gives simply the image it self.
(2) (8%) The filter for image enhancement can be designed by first-order derivatives and second- order derivatives. Compare the first-order derivatives and the second-order derivatives, which one is better for image enhancement. Explain why.
Answer (2):
The first order derivate method uses a boundary point. This method may lead to the edge points to detect excessive data storage. Theoretically more effective way is to determine the point with maximum value in ladder and these points are to be considered as edge point.
Second order derivate method can detect more precise edge. The first derivate of the local maximum corresponds to the second derivate zero-crossing point. So more accurate edge points can be found by determination of the zero crossing point of the second derivative of image gray.
So as a result one dimensional operators Roberts, Sobel and Prewitt are able to handle treatment effect of images of more gray scale gradient and noise.
(3) (8%) An edge image (E) is generated by filtering a gray scale image (I) by a Laplacian mask (M). The sharpening image can be obtained by simply adding the original image (I) and the edge image (E). Show a single mask (S) based on the mask M such that the image sharpening can be implemented with one pass of the single mask.
 1 1 1 
   M=1−81
  
 1 1 1    
Answer (3):
111 S= 1 -7 1
111
Mask will be like this because question wants us to make sharpening in one turn so we try to make Laplacian and adding image it self so I find that if we multiply with -7 which is adding one to -8 going to give us the correct result.
(4) (8%) To extract edge information of an image, people can either (a) Blur the image first, then apply edge detector
or
(b) Apply edge detector first, then do the image blurring.
Which way is better, explain why.
Answer (4):
I think (a) Blur the image first, then apply edge detector is much better because with unexpected noise our edge detector will fail and show us some unreliable also wrong results. With blurring first, we can get much more smooth images and then can get edge information more accurate and clear.
(5) (12%) Apply the median filter to remove the noises in the following image I:
44444444 4 4 4 48 4 4 4 4 4 4 64 64 64 64 4 4 41764649664 4 4 4 4 64 85 64 64 8 4 4 4 64 64 64 64 4 4 4 56 4 4 23 4 4 4 44444444
(note: assume that all the pixels outside the image have value: 4)
(a) Use 3*3 square-shape median filter to filter image I, obtain image M1; (b) Use 5*5 cross-shape median filter to filter image I, obtain image M2; (c) Compare M1 and M2, indicate which filter is better, and explain why.
Answer (5):
(a)
M1=
44444444 44444444
4 4 48 64
4 4 64 64
4 4 64 64
4 4 56 64 44444444
64 4 4 4 64 64 4 4 64 64 4 4 64 23 4 4
44444444
(b) 44444444 4444 4444
4 4 64 64 64 64 4 4 M2= 4 4 64 64 64 64 4 4 4 4 64 64 64 64 4 4 4 4 64 64 64 64 4 4 44444444 44444444
(c) I think second one makes the image more blurry because it get rid of the pixels with different values more easily so to make it much more noise free.
II. (44%) Programming: Scale Space using Laplacian of Gaussian operator; Unsharp Masking, and Sobel Operator;
Description: Unsharp masking, Sobel operator, Laplacian of Gaussian operator, and Scale Space filter can be used for edge detection and enhancement. Apply these operators to a gray scale image to generate the edge image. In this assignment, you will implement these algorithms, and get various details of edge information in a given gray scale image.

 f2: ant_gray
(2) (10%) Apply the Unsharp Masking method to enhance the edges of images (f1, f2) and obtain the enhanced image E1 and E2;
 E1: basel_unsharp
 E2: ant_unsharp
(3) (10%) Apply the Sobel operator to the two images (f1, f2) and generate the edge image Es1 and Es2;
